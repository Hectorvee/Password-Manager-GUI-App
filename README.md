    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git
    cd password-manager
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pyperclip
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python password_manager.py
    ```

2. The main window will appear with the following options:
    - **Website**: Enter the website for which you want to save the password.
    - **Email/Username**: Enter your email or username for the website.
    - **Password**: Enter a password or click "Generate Password" to create a strong password.
    - **Add**: Save the entered details.
    - **Search**: Retrieve saved details for a specific website.

## File Structure

- `password_manager.py`: The main application file.
- `password_info.json`: The file where passwords are stored.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `logo.png`: The logo image used in the application.

## Code Overview

### Password Generation

The password is generated using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. The length and composition are randomized to ensure strong passwords.

### Saving Passwords

Passwords are saved in a JSON file (`password_info.json`). The application checks for duplicate entries and prompts the user before saving.

### Searching Passwords

Users can search for saved passwords by entering the website name. The application retrieves and displays the associated username and password.
